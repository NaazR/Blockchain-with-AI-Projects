# Blockchain-with-AI-Projects
These projects are combining AI with Blockchain
The AI Agent reviews student project descriptions and determines whether they demonstrate effort and learning.

If APPROVED, the system automatically sends 0.001 Sepolia ETH to the student’s wallet.

If REJECTED, the student receives feedback explaining why.

All approved grants are recorded on-chain via a smart contract event.
